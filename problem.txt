Travelling Salesman:

We have a Redis in cloud where we store one way flights from city X to city Y with the following details:

Flight route: from X to Y
Price of the flight
Time duration
departure hour (local timezone)
arrival hour (local timezone)


Your task is to offer the best price route to the client from city A to city B with the shortest duration.

* Iam assuming same routes flights have same durations.
